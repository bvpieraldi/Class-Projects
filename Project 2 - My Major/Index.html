                        <td id="type"><p>I chose this major because I’m a creative person and very "artsy". I originally was sticking to majoring in graphic design. last Fall at AACC I took my first Web Design class as a requirement. I then continued to enjoy it and took my 2nd web design class. I started to learn more and more CSS and HTML and even an introduction to JavaScript. As a graphic designer I like making logo’s and designs. Then, I was fascinated by the logical and organization of designing through HTML and CSS. Throughout school my best “real subject” was always math. I enjoy math and the problem solving of I but, nothing I would want to major in. I think HTML and CSS sort of has that same logic and problem solving aspects, making it  “mathematical” in some ways.</p>
                            <p>This does make me think even more about computer programming in general since it does involve good math skills. I also enjoy UX and creating wireframes! BEAWRE: Nerdy</p>
