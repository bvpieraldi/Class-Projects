	<h3>My History</h3>
	<p>I was in Baltimore, MD on that speical day called "Vaentines Day", 1997. I grew up in Riva, where I spent most my childhood running around. I lived right next to the water and thought I could once be a mermaid... but that didn't work out. After a couple years we moved to the house that I still live at until this day in Edgewater.</p>
	
	<p>Ever since I was a youngin' I loved to sing and be apart of music. My parents who are also musicians would siing on stage and I would always hop on and pretend to perform. Now I am a aspiring singer who tries to preform whenever I can. My faorite singers are Ed Sheeran, Frank Sinatra, and Amy Whinehouse</p>
	
	<p>My favorite hobby is photography. I enjoy snapping photos of my friends and epseically myself! I've alawyas been very photogenic. I love going out to beautiful landscapes and taking photos. Also my dad has a business that does wedding videography and I help him out as a 2nd videographer. The business is called "KeepsakeSoundVideo"</p>
	
	<p>I don't eat a lot of ice cream!!</p>
